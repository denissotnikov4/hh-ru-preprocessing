This dataset contains 15 year IT job data from 2006 to 2020, downloaded from hh.ru using their public API. 
This dataset was processed using Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib technologies. 
As a result, I almost got rid of the categorical data, but my computer resources, as well as the resources of Google Colaboratory, 
were not enough to process all the categorical data.
